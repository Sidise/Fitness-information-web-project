I created the following web page inspired by the fitness information idea provided by our professor as an example.
In the given file, we have app.js the runnable app file with REST API files and a node module folder created by Express along with 2 JSON files. For our index.html page, we have a css file that modifies the styling. I have also included javascript code for style modification.
Index.html, is our web page where we have menu to the microservice pages which are bmi,bodyfat,idealweight,and caloriesburned. 


To run the program, you go to the command line and enter the assignment folder path in the device. Then we enter npm install express to the comand line. Finally, we run the program with "node app.js" which will launch our localhost:3000. Then we go to our browser and enter localhost:3000, and this will run the web page.



Thank You!
